# all-of-regex
In this repository, I'm trying to collect information abour Regular Expressions (aka regex). So it can also be thought of as a tutorial.<br>
The name is inspired from the book "All of Statistics" by Larry A. Wasserman. <br>
Up until now, my resources are the following (which will grow as I read more on the topic):
* Coursera NLP course by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning, Week 2, Lecture 2 [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyzTQ0OKeNw), [[PDF]](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/2_TextProc.pdf)
* SoloLearn Python course, Module 8 [[link]](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/)

I think it is a good idea to have SoloLearn codes in a notebook, as it can be more interactive, and the learner can play with the code right away. Also it focused on the implementation of regex in Python, as opposed to Jurafsky's lecture which was more theoretical.

I will continue updating this repository. I'd be glad to hear your ideas to make this better; So feel free to fork it or suggest me any edits.
